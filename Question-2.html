Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch
components in React Router.


Ans:- 
BrowserRouter:    
               The top-level component that wraps your entire application and enables client-side routing by managing the URL history. 
                You typically only need one "BrowserRouter" per application. 

Route:
        Defines a single route with a specific path and the component to render when that path is accessed. 
        Each "Route" is nested within the "BrowserRouter". 

Key attribute: 
               "path" which specifies the URL pattern to match. 

Link:
      A clickable component that generates a link to navigate to a different route within your application. 
      When clicked, it updates the URL in the browser without a full page reload. 
      Key attribute: "to" which specifies the target path to navigate to. 

Switch: 
        A component that only renders the first matching "Route" from its children when multiple routes might match the current URL. 
        Useful for preventing unintended rendering of multiple components when routes overlap.
